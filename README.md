## Description

(Version 1.0)
THESNEAKERFELLOWSHIP is a sneaker marketplace web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This platform serves as a hub for sneaker enthusiasts, allowing users to sign up, log in, and search for sneakers while providing direct links to purchase them through my own e-commerce platforms or StockX. 
Additionally, the app integrates the Sneaks API to showcase upcoming sneaker releases, keeping users informed about the latest drops.

ðŸš€ Features (Version 1.0):
1. Sneaker Search: Search for sneakers by brand, name, or model.
2. Sneaker Gallery: Showcases popular sneakers and my personal stock with more.
3. Dynamic Filters: Sort and filter results based on brand (Nike, Yeezy, Jordan, etc.).
4. Sneaks API Integration 
5. User Authentication: Sign up and log in functionality for a personalized experience.
6. Fully Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile.
7. MongoDB Cloud Database: Stores user data, sneaker collections, and user preferences.
8. Render Deployment: Fully hosted on Render for easy access.

Future Enhancements & Planned Features
As I continue to develop my skills, future updates will introduce a fully integrated shopping experience, including:

1. Dedicated Shop Page: A built-in store will replace external links, allowing users to browse and buy directly from the site.
2. Shopping Cart & Checkout System: Users will be able to add sneakers to their cart and complete purchases with ease.
3. Integration with Payment APIs (Stripe, PayPal): Secure and seamless transactions will be enabled through trusted payment gateways.
4. Order Tracking & User Profiles: Users will have personalized accounts to track orders and manage their purchase history.
5. Admin Panel for Inventory Management: A backend dashboard for stock management, order processing, and analytics.
6. I will also add my full stock list as I have over 1000 pairs.
